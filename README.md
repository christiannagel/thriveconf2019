## Entity Framework Core Features

EF Core is not only a modern version of Entity Framework, it also offers many features not available with Entity Framework. In this session you learn many differences, including how to implement logging, changes with mapping including shadow properties, mapping to fields, owned types and owned collections, using model type query filters, migrations including seeding of data, and more. You'll also see how EF Core can map to a NoSQL Database with the Azure Cosmos DB provider.
